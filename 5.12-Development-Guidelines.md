The Code Conventions used are those of the respective programming language.

For Java these would be 'Code Conventions for the Java
Programming Language'. They can be found under

For Angular we use the Angular style guide, found under [](url)https://angular.io/guide/styleguide .

The Git workflow features split _main_ and _dev_ branches. User stories are developed on their own _feature-x_ branch, these being split off from the _dev_ branch. A merge of the _dev_ branch into the _main_ branch only happens for stable and consistent versions of the _dev_ branch.
Changes will only be commited after the maven _package_ command has run successfully.
