## List of risks for the project

Calculating and ranking the most important risks for the success of the project. Risk is calculated by multiplying the probability of occurrence with the potential severity in case of occurrence. The goal is to identify 4 most important risks and continuously monitor them throughout the development of the project. Re-evaluation of these risks should also occur in the course of the project.

Top 4 risks for the project:

* Unfinished user stories (3.)
* Sick team member (1.)
* Team member quits (2.)
* Progress is lost (9.)

---

1. Team member gets sick or is otherwise unavailable for for a short period of time

* Probability of occurrence: about 0.75 with 0.20 per member
* Potential severity: 2
* Risk: 1.5

* Responsible members: deputy of whoever is missing
* Category: project independent

---

2. Team member decides to quit the course or becomes permanently inactive

* Probability of occurrence: about 0.25 with 0.05 per member
* Potential severity: 5
* Risk: 1.25
* Countermeasures: Time buffer, Deputy must take over and work must be split among the remaining members
