Guaranteeing a lack of errors and the required, proper and seamless functioning of the software produced by our team is of the utmost importance to the project. To ensure this goal is met, a comprehensive set of tests must be carried out on it at every stage of development. Furthermore, testing provides valuable insight into the progress carried out by developers and provides feedback on what functions of the programme actually work at any given point in time.

## Scope

Tests are to be carried out on a continuous basis throughout the entire duration of development, especially after the implementation of a new feature or the altering of existing functions or features. Tests must check the behaviour of the system after performing requests or carrying out functions and check whether the system produces a response in line with the expectations laid down for the programme. This applies to both the backend and frontend software.

Tests should be ideally performed at least twice to rule out the possibility of a false positive test result. 

A system test, consisting of a series of manual tests testing the entire functionality of the programme should take place towards the end of the project, when all functionality has been implemented. Automatic tests should take place regularly during the implementation of the project to ensure the constant functionality of features introduced.

Each series of tests should have positive tests and negative tests. Having both types of tests ensures that the software functions properly and is also able to reject incorrect requests that could harm the system.

JUnit tests are the preferred test type for the automatic tests.

### Frontend

The frontend is to be primarily tested using manual tests. Manual tests involve the tester checking whether a given function in the software performs as required by performing the action manually in the application and checking the result of the action performed.

Unit tests are to be performed during the implementation of the frontend, ensuring the behaviour of each page and/or element of the web application performs as needed.

Integration tests are also to be used when implementing the frontend, in order to ensure that the frontend application interacts properly with the backend by sending correct requests. The body of the requests is to be checked in these tests also.

### Backend

The backend can be tested both manually and automatically. The interactions between layers can be tested using integration tests, while single classes, modules or functions should be tested using unit tests. Automatisation can be of benefit to testers in this case, as backend functions and interactions can be easily checked automatically for a correct result/response. Backend tests are to be carried out after the implementation of a new feature, as well as at the end of development.

### Security

Due to requirements laid down upon the development team, the security of the system should be tested at least once throughout the entire development process, preferably once shortly after the implementation of a feature and once at the end of development. This includes, but its not limited to, checking the safety of the system against SQL injections, as well as checking the permissions of users to view certain resources. System tests should be used to perform this check, so testing may not take place when the feature is not complete. Both manual and automatic tests may be used to perform these tests.

### Performance

Due to requirements laid down upon the development team, the performance of the system should be tested at least once throughout the entire development process, preferably once shortly after the implementation of a feature and once at the end of development. This involves checking whether the requirements on the software with regard to performance are met. These tests may be automatised to improve the measurement of time.

### Usability

Due to requirements laid down upon the development team, the usability of the system should be tested at least once throughout the entire development process, especially at the end of development. These tests check whether the frontend meets the requirements laid down by the team with regard to usability. Manual tests are to be performed to check these requirements.

## Organisation
Tickets must be opened for each test to be carried out, with the ticket being unassigned until the test is to be performed, when it will be assigned to the test performer. Tickets created must be put into a single category to allow for quick access to test results.

The tester must perform the test as described in the ticket, after which he must fill out the test result template (provided under 5.9) and include it as a comment in the test ticket. After completing this, the ticket may be moved to closed.
