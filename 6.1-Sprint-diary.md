## Sprint 1

### Status update

Login and registration have been successfully implemented.

Venue maps, ticket acquisition and the creation of events have been partially completed but are not finished yet.

### Results of sprint retrospective

Uneven distribution of work due to wrong expectations and evaluation of storypoints.

Sometimes collaboration would not have worked, which in turn lead to more hours and made the work distribution uneven (Adam's case).

Ticket Story members were at times stuck due to needing part of other peoples stories to continue (Szymon & Tobias - Tickets case)

#### Lessons:

Members should communicate more actively if they could use help, need more contribution of someone else. More proactive communication.

## Sprint 2

### Status update

#### Finished

Profile editing / deletion

Create user / unlock user

#### Almost Finished

Location (Tests)

Events (Tests)

Time/Date (Tests)

### Results of Retrospective

* Would be appreciated if when varying off domain model would be mentioned before implementation
* Merges to dev branch preferably when the to be merged branch is in a more or less finished state

## Sprint 3

### Status update:

* Finished resetting password by user and admin
* Finished filtering events and acts (except testing)
* Implemented buying and reserving tickets (except testing)
* Implemented bonus account/points (except testing)
* Invoices almost finished
* Implemented merch shop (except testing)
* Top 10 events: Missing tests and SQL errors?

### Retrospective

* Communicate more regularly to have even workloads.
* Too few meetings, which leads to a lack of overview over the progress of the project.
* Perhaps have smaller meetings in which only those take part who are involved in the implementation.
* While there is room for improvement, communication and distribution of workload still works far better than at the beginning

## Sprint 4

* News & data generators, finished unfinished stories, complete testing
* Finished buying, reserving and canceling tickets 
* Finished implementation of Top10 events finished
* Finished merchandise and bonus point shop
* Added pagination where needed
* Expanded and fixed automated testing
* Fixed errors that occured in manual system test
* Expanded data generators

### Retrospective

* Communicated more regularly to have even workloads.
* More meetings, which lead to a better overview over the progress of the project.
* Had smaller meetings in which only those take part who are involved in the implementation.
* Immense improvement of communication and distribution of workload compared to the start of the project
* Merging more often lead to less conflicts and quicker updates for others
