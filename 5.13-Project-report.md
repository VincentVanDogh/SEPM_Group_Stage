## Introduction:

<div>

This report provides a retrospective of the group project.

The goal is to summarize the progress of the project and identify possible improvement potentials for future projects.

## Sprints:

### Number of Sprints: 4

### Sprint Goals:

The goals of each sprint were often not fully achieved.

In particular, ticket purchase turned out to be much more challenging than assumed and affected all 4 sprints.

As a result, we also did not provide a functioning prototype after each sprint.

### Sprint 1:

The first sprint was characterized by a lack of experience and corresponding misjudgments. This led to a large difference in time tracking and some goals not being successfully completed.

### Sprint 2:

After re-evaluating the story points and slowly getting used to the technology, work became more efficient and better distributed in sprint 2. This reduced the disparity in time tracking. Nevertheless, all goals were not achieved here either.

### Sprint 3:

Improved communication allowed for faster work and most of the user stories were completed. The ticket purchase was also completed except for some details. Although not everything was completed as originally planned in sprint 3, it was still the sprint in which the most progress was made.

### Sprint 4:

The remaining user stories and automated tests were completed quickly by agreeing on more frequent meetings and much better communication. Afterwards, a system test, bug fixes, and improvement of the user interface followed.

## Problems:

### Encountered Problems:

Misjudgment of story points led to unequal distribution and incomplete fulfillment of sprint goals.

Problems during merge.

### Reaction:

Re-evaluate story points, improve communication and pay more attention to time tracking, adding a fourth sprint towards the end.

Merging manually and deciding to do more smaller merges in the future.

### Identification as Risk:

The risk of **not finishing a user story at the end of a sprint** and of **problems during merges** were assesed in the risk management.

### Risk Assessment:

**A User story not beeing finished at the end of a sprint** was was one of the risk assesments with a 0.8/1 propability to occur and 2/10 severity. Due to our poor assesment of story points it happened in oru first 3 sprints. But since we had enough of a timebuffer as a counter measure it didn't end up beeing a problem

**A Failed Merge** was one of the risk assesments aswell with a 0.8/1 propability to occur and 1/10 severity. It was well assesed as it indeed happended but wasn't a major problem.

### Collaboration:

Collaboration with the tutor and assistant: The weekly JFs with the tutor were very helpful in solving problems and sometimes even identifying them. Paulina gave us helpful feedback and was almost always available to help us with questions. Even outside of meetings, she was reachable by email and answered questions directly or cleared them with the assistant. The scheduling of JFs, IRs or MRs was flexible and without problems.

### Collaboration in the team:

Because all team members were willing to communicate openly and motivated to work, there was always a good atmosphere in the team. Everyone was always helpful and flexible when it came to work distribution and meetings.

## Evaluation:

### Successful Aspects:

Learning new technologies, improvement of communication, experience in working as a team.

### Negatives:

Poor preparation and misjudgment of story points lead to unequal distribution of work at the start.

### Learnt:

More frequent meetings and quick open communication enable better workflow, handling Angular and Spring Boot.

### Potential for improvement:

Better planning of the UML diagram before start, more meetings and better communication from the beginning.
