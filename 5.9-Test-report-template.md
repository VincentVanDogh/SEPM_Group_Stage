| Total no. of test cases | Test cases carried out | Tests passed (%) | Errors noted in test protocols |
|--|--|--|--|
| 0 | 0 | 0 (NA%) | NA |

### Error analysis
1. ***Is failed test result of an error in the system or an erroneous test case, test carried out wrong, etc?***
XXXX

2. ***Is the error known from other tests?***
XXXX

3. **Error classification:**
- [ ] **Class 1**: Erroneous specification
- [ ] **Class 2**: System crash
- [ ] **Class 3**: Essential functionality is erroneous
- [ ] **Class 4**: Functional deviation or limitation
- [ ] **Class 5**: Minor deviation
- [ ] **Class 6**: Aesthetic mistakes

4. **Prioritisation:**
- [ ] **Level 1**: Immediate fix
- [ ] **Level 2**: Fix in next version
- [ ] **Level 3**: Fix will take place on occasion
- [ ] **Level 4**: Fix plan not determined yet

### Conclusions
- *How should the condition of the software be assessed?*
- *Were the quality objectives achieved?*
- *What consequences can be drawn from the current state, including: How can errors be avoided in the future, how can the development process be improved?*
